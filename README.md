KSP_NERVA
==========================================================================================================================

LVN to NERVA conversion for KSP

This modification changes the specifications of the Squad-designed LV-N Atomic Rocket Motor to match the specifications of the Los Alamos designed NERVA engine. 

This mod is a TOTAL CONVERSION of the LV-N engine as of 4/2/2014. Later revisions of this mod will create a seperate component for the NERVA engine, allowing the player to use both the LV-N and the NERVA in game.

SPECIFIC CHANGES:
==========================================================================================================================

- Max. Thrust has been changed from 60kN to 330kN
- ISP(atmo/vacu) has been changed from (220/800) to (380/850)
- No longer requires Oxidizer

INSTALLATION:
==========================================================================================================================

To install this mod, download the repository as a .zip file, and then extract the "nuclearEngine" folder and place it in the following directory: 

(INSTALL DIRECTORY)/Kerbal Space Program/GameData/Squad/Parts/Engine/

This will overwrite the current "nuclearEngine" containing the code for the original LV-N motor. It is advised to back this folder up somewhere else (outside of the GameData folder) if you wish to eventually revert. 

I will hopefully create a stand alone part sometime in the future to allow for both the LV-N and NERVA to exist at the same time. 

Launch KSP, and your new NERVA engine should be in the build menu!
